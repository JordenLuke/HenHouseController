This project aims to automate the control of light and water heating in my chicken coop using the ESP8266 module. While it may seem straightforward, the light control system incorporates advanced features beyond a simple on-off timer. The primary goal is to optimize the amount of light the chickens receive while minimizing artificial lighting. This is achieved by integrating the "https://sunrise-sunset.org/api" and "http://worldtimeapi.org/api/ip" APIs.

The light control system operates as follows: At midnight, the ESP8266 retrieves the sunrise and sunset times. It then requests the current Unix time. This information calculates the time intervals in milliseconds until 6 am, sunrise, sunset, and 9 pm. At 6 am, the light is activated and remains on until 30 minutes after sunrise. It is activated 30 minutes before sunset and remains on until 9 pm. Additionally, the light will be triggered when the temperature inside the henhouse drops to 10째F and turned off when it reaches 20째F.

The water heating control system follows a comparable pattern. It monitors the water temperature and activates the heating element when the temperature drops to 33.0째F. The heating is then deactivated once the temperature reaches 35.0째F.
